        "\n",
        "This raisees the question of how to set `nseg`, or in other words, how many numerical segments should be used? Similar to the time step for discretizing time, reducing the segment size (by increasing the number of segments) increases accuracy but with higher computational cost (simulations will take longer to run). One rule of thumb is called the *d_lambda rule*, which uses a term called the frequency dependent space constant $\\lambda_{f}$. This is similar to the one we derived in class, but it incorporates the effect of the frequency of signals on their spatial attenuation. The d_lambda rule gives the biggest segment size $\\Delta x$ to use for the frequency dependent length constant at a frequency of interest, given by:\n",

        "Here, $d$ is diameter, $f$ is frequency, $\\rho_{i}$ is specific resistance of the intracellular space, and $c_{m}$ is the specific membrane capacitance. Since the segment size is given by the section length $L$ divided by the number of segments `nseg` ($\\Delta x = L/nseg$), you can use this equation to set `nseg` by rearranging to $nseg >= L/\\Delta x$. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our first model will be *passive* and linear, meaning there are no voltage-gated conductances (which produce *active*, nonlinear currents). The axon will have a diameter of $5 \\; \\mu m$ and length of $3 \\; mm$. \n",
        "\n",
        "For its biophysical properties, we'll then insert the `pas` mechanism, which includes `g_pas` and `e_pas`. The specific membrane capacitance `cm` is $1 \\; \\mu F / cm^{2}$ `g_pas` is $5 \\cdot 10^{-4} S/cm^{2}$, and `e_pas` is 0 $mV$ (so we can visualize changes in $V_{m}$ from rest more easily). Finally, we'll also have to set a parameter we didn't use before, the axial resistance. In NEURON, this is given by the parameter `Ra`, which is equivalent to the *resistivity* $\\rho$ used above and in class, with units $\\Omega \\cdot cm$. We'll set `Ra` to 200 $\\Omega \\cdot cm$. "

For the latter case, you can imagine a synaptic input generating a postsynpatic current somewhere along a dendrite, which would create some voltage profile along the cell and leading back to the soma.

        "I refered to the axon we're modeling as unmyelinated, so let's take a second to review what I mean by that. A large number of axons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems have repeating sections of their membrane wrapped with an insulating layer of lipid membrane called *myelin*. Myelin is formed by a *glia cells*, which are a separate class of cells in the nervous system that play a variety of roles, including myelinating axons both during development and in maturity. \n",
        "\n",
        "In between the myelinated sections, called *internodes*, are short ($~1 \\; \\mu m$), exposed regions of cell membrane called *nodes of Ranvier*. Since the myelin wrappings are predominantly lipid bilayers (no channels), they have very high membrane resistance. And since current passing through them would pass through the layers in series, their capacitance divides by the number of layers (while resistance adds in series), giving a much lower membrane capacitance. These two properties cause membrane currents to become restricted to the nodes of Ranvier and membrane voltage in the myelinated region to evolve more rapidly, leading to *saltatory propagation* of action potentials in myelinated axons, as in, the action potential \"jumps\" from node to node. This results in much faster propagation speeds without having to adjust diameter. Myelin is especially useful because biological organisms would generally like to transmit signals quickly (e.g., if you're being chased by a predator you want to be able to perceive and respond to the threat as fast as possible). But, our bodies have finite space and metabolic resources. So, by using myelin, axons can transmit rapid action potentials in smaller diameter axons.   \n",

Start with a myelinated axon composed of 21 nodes and 20 internodes, with a nodal diameter of $5 \\; \\mu m$ and length of $3 \\; \\mu m$. Use an `nseg` of 1 in the nodes 11 in the internodes.\n",
